## ~~Dual Branch~~
**This branch is currently not being worked on. If anything changes I'll be sure to update the README.md. Thank you!**

If you're running this on a cronjob I recommend you use the dual branch and set the **InstagramGrab.py** to run roughly 5-10 minutes beforehand, since the **HorrorBot.py** file will only take 10-20 seconds to complete.<br>
This branch is still in testing, and if all goes well and I refine it enough I may merge it into the origin/master branch, but that's for a later date.
