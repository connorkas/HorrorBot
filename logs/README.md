# Logs Directory
At the moment, logs should be moved manually into this folder. Each type you run this script, it will create a file with today's date, such as: **2022-03-21-HB.log**. It's best to create a directory manually after each successful cronjob run.<br>

It's your script/bot, but I would add the resulting *-HB.log file, *.dream files, and the outputURL, just to keep things clean.
